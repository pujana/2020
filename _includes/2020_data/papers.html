		After the first CoG in London, UK, CoG 2020 brings together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry in the field of games to Osaka, Japan, to discuss recent advances and explore future directions. Games offer a fantastic domain for computational creativity, game design, technology, education, social sciences and, undoubtedly, artificial and computational intelligence. We look forward to your contributions.
