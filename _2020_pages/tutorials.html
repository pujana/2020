	We invite submissions for tutorials to be held at CoG 2019. This is an opportunity for you to share your expertise and influence future research directions in the CoG community. Tutorials can be on any topic in the scope of the conference. Please note that this is the first year CoG has an expanded scope beyond computational intelligence, to include all technical research areas as they intersect with games. We especially encourage tutorials that reflect and respond to this broader scope. For a partial list of topics relevant to the expanded scope of the conference, please visit <a href="/topics">http://www.ieee-cog.org/topics/</a>
