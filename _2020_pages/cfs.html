<p>
	As successfully done in CoG 2019, we are looking for sponsors that help us build a strong conference and community for research in games.
	Most of the attendees and participants of game events benefit from tailored career opportunities presented at the conferences. We intend to support the young professionals to such career opportunities at IEEE CoG.
</p>
<p>
	IEEE CoG provides a unique platform for industrial sponsors to present themselves to potential employees in the area of games with expertise in AI, Computational Intelligence, Design and Games Technology. Our participants’ expertise goes even beyond a developer‘s profession. We have the following statistics from previous IEEE CIS conferences:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Professors and experts in AI and computer games: 20%</li>
	<li>Researchers and young professionals: 60%</li>
	<li>Graduate and undergraduate students: 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>
	By sponsoring you will be helping us organize the best possible conference and experience for professionals, researchers, speakers, guests and delegates.
</p>
<p>
	What’s in it for a sponsor? It will give you access and positive branding for:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Leading game research groups</li>
	<li>Investment in R&D for game companies</li>
	<li>Students, researchers and professionals that attend the conference</li>
	<li>Recruitment opportunities among the top practitioners in the field of AI and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The following are the sponsorship options we offer, although we are open to consider other suggestions:
