The CoG 2020 Organising Committee invites proposals for competitions to be held at the conference. These may be completely new ones or competitions held already in the last years, possibly at other venues. Proposals are <b>due by 14th January 2020</b>, and will be reviewed based on their relevance to the CoG community. Please see <a href="topics">the topics covered by the CoG conference</a>. Competitions can be based on well-known games as well, but competitions based on custom-made and lesser-known games are also welcome. The competition needs to define a set of rules and objectives for determining the score of each player.</p>

<p><u>To submit your proposal, send an email</u> with the title <b>"CoG 2020 Competition Proposal"</b> to the competition chair <a href="mailto:diego.perez@qmul.ac.uk">Diego Perez Liebana</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please, include the following information with your proposal:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Organisers’ names.</li>
    <li>Competition title.</li>
    <li>Description of the competition (about 200 words).</li>
    <li>Web address.</li>
    <li>Whether the competition will have several tracks or not, and if they should be considered different competitions or a single one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, the following item can be submitted with the proposal or later:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Video of the competition/tracks (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please, also note the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/StudentGameCOMP" target="_blank">IEEE CIS Student Game-Based Competition Sub-Committee (SGBC)</a> has determined, in agreement with the Games TC meeting held at CIG 2017, that all competitions (including all tracks) <b>must provide a short video for entrants</b>. Competitions that do not provide this video will not be accepted at CoG 2020. However, <b>submission of the video is not necessary for the proposal</b> but can be deferred to after provisional acceptance of the competition.
     This requirement applies to both new and old competitions. The objective of creating these videos is to raise the general quality of our competitions and attract as many participants as possible by providing an easier start with the respective frameworks. The duration of the video is to be decided by the organizers, but it should have (English) subtitles to aid non-native English speakers. The content should demo concepts like how to install the required software packages, write an entry for the competition and submission instructions. The rationale is that if the whole process can be shown in less than 5 minutes, participants will feel more encouraged to participate and prepare a submission for the contest.<br><br></li>


    <li>We will of course provide certificates for all competitions and we will try to make some price money available, but we also encourage the organizers to look for financial sponsorship to make their competition more attractive.<br><br></li>

    <li><b>Competition papers</b>.
    These are <a href="/cfp">regular papers</a> <b>(up to 8 pages)</b> that describe one or more entries to the competitions that are running at this year’s CIG. Competition papers need to include evaluation of the contribution, including (if possible) results on the same benchmark as that used by the competition, and comparison to other competition entries. Because the problem domain is well-known, these papers can be reviewed faster than regular papers. The same quality standards will apply to competition papers as to regular papers. Competition papers should be submitted by <b>15th May 2020</b>. <b>The competitions do not need to be accompanied by competition papers</b>; a competition can run even in the absence of any submitted papers.<br><br></li>
