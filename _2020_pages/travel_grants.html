				<ul>
					<li>Membership of IEEE (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/index.html" target="_blank">join IEEE here</a>)</li>
					<li>Membership of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMCIS011" target="_blank">join IEEE CIS here</a>). Note that IEEE CIS is listed as an optional society membership under IEEE.</li>

					<li>A <b>“Proof of University Attendance”</b> on university letterhead certifying that the student carries at least 50% of a normal full-time academic program as a registered undergraduate or graduate student in a regular course of study.</li>
					<li>A <b>“Recommendation Letter”</b> from the student’s supervising professor on university letterhead that the student is the major contributor to the paper and approximately what was the student’s contribution in percent to the paper. <b>Please include for each paper, the ID number as given by the conference organizers</b>. In the event that the student is the sole author of the paper, no letter is needed.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Requirements for Professionals from Developing Countries</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Be a <b>higher-grade member</b> of IEEE and IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMCIS011" target="_blank">join IEEE CIS here</a>).</li>
					<li>Be the <b>author or co-author</b> of an accepted paper in the conference, actually attend the conference and present the paper.</li>
					<li>A <b>“Contribution Letter”</b> confirming that you have contributed to at least 50% of the research presented, <b>including paper title, ID number and co-author name of each paper</b>.</li>
					<li>A <b>“Funding Justification Letter”</b> attesting by an honor-bound signature that the conference registration fee would pose an economic hardship on the applicant, such that they would be unable to attend the conference without the support of the travel grant.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Instructions</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Browse to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciDyCd9B2TH7Pw49t-9fdvA6vXWTHwm0rTBJMEEcdxRq80eA/viewform" target="_blank">IEEE CIS Travel Grant Application Link</a></li>
					<li>Follow the instructions and fill all the data in the form. Note that, after acceptance, each nominee will be asked to provide a proof of student status and recommendation letter (for students), or a funding justification letter and a letter confirming the percentage of involvement (for young professionals). We will request for these documents in a second step. They <b>can not</b> be uploaded in this form.</li>
					<li>Finally press “Submit” to complete your application!</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Important notes</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Applicants must be IEEE CIS members in order to be able to process your application.</b></li>
					<li>Only one author per paper will be awarded a travel grant and an applicant can receive only one grant per year.</li>
					<li>IEEE/IEEE CIS Membership will be confirmed automatically through the IEEE Member database.</li>
					<li>Student applicants will be required to present proof of university attendance documentation at the conference.</li>
					<li>Students who receive travel grants will be expected to volunteer to assist the conference management team. Duties may include assisting with registration, ticket acceptance, audio-visual requirements, and other conference matters. It is not expected that this volunteering will interfere with any student's opportunity to attend most of the technical sessions, nor with presenting their own paper at the meeting.</li>
