    <li><b>Example topics</b> – a bullet list of topics that the session might cover.</li>
    <li><b>Justification</b> – a brief explanation making the case that the special session belongs in the conference. An estimate of the number of submissions should be included.</li>
    <li><b>Sponsors</b> – a list of researchers proposing the session. At least one must be an IEEE member and all sponsors are expected to serve as reviewers for the papers in the special session. If your session is accepted, you must also provide a list of reviewers sufficient to your expected submissions.</li>

Proposals must be in PDF format and will be approved on a rolling basis (submit now!), reviewed promptly, and placed on the conference web site, in part to prevent duplicate submissions.
