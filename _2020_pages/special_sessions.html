	A special session addresses a topic area within games research and is intended to bring together researchers working on a topic to provide an excellent session on that topic at the conference on games. Please read the <a href="/topics">call for papers</a> for CoG 2019 to determine if your proposed <a href="/topics">topic</a> is one we are able to accept.
</p>
<p>
	A special session proposal <b>should not be more than two pages</b>, not including the brief biographies of the proposers and the draft call for papers.
