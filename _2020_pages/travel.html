	<h2>How to get to Osaka</h2>
	<p>
		A typically recommended way to get to Osaka is to arrive at Kansai International Airport (KIX) by plane, which is one of major international airports in Japan and is located in Osaka. KIX provides direct services to more than 80 cities and 20 countries/regions throughout the world, including many cities in Japan. The airport, which acts as an Asian hub and serves a large number of flights to the Asia-Pacific region, is conveniently located within 30 minutes by train to and from downtown Osaka.

	<p>
		There is also a domestic airport, Osaka International Airport (ITM), in Osaka. ITM does not have any international flights, but you can get there by using domestic flights from other airports in Japan.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Apart from KIX and ITM, there are other two major international airports in Japan: Narita Airport (NRT), and Haneda Airport (HND), which are both located in Tokyo. You can get to Osaka from NRT and HND by train (Shinkansen) or get to KIX or ITM via domestic flights.
