				<h3>Venue</h3>
				<p>
					
					All the sessions will take place at the Blossom Cafe on the main campus of Kindai University. We can use two rooms on the third floor for the paper sessions. Coffee breaks, lunch, and registration will be in the lounge room on the second floor. In the followings, we assume that the number of participants is at most 180. If it exceeds 180, we should change rooms to other rooms in the University. Fortunately, August is on summer holiday so that we will be able to use broader rooms as we like. The keynote, panel, paper, and poster sessions will take place at the multi-purpose hall on the third floor. The capacity of the hall is 180 as shown in the figure below.

				<p>Osaka is located on the main island of Honshu, roughly in the center of Japan. Osaka Prefecture is divided into 33 cities, 9 towns, and 1 village. Covering an area of approximately 1,899 square kilometers, or only 0.5% of the nation's entire land area, Osaka is the second smallest prefecture. However, it has a population of 8.8 million, or roughly 7% of the entire population, making it the third most populous prefecture after Tokyo and Kanagawa prefectures. Furthermore, approximately 210,000 non-Japanese, or 9.7% of all non-Japanese registered in Japan, reside in Osaka.</p>
				
				
				<p>Geographically Osaka extends from north to south, with a slight curve. It faces Osaka Bay
					to the west and is surrounded by mountains on the other three sides. The weather is
					generally mild, with four distinct seasons. Osaka's average August high is 33 &#xb0;C ( 91.4 &#xb0;C) , with
					an average low of 25 &#xb0;C (77 &#xb0;C ), and average precipitation is 102 mm.
					</p><p>In the recorded history of Japan, several ancient capitals were located for a long time in the
					Kansai region (western Japan) including Kyoto, Kobe and Nara. In this region, Osaka is being
					developed as a center of economy, industries and world trade. Osaka still continues to play
					a leading role in these fields in modern Japan.
					</p><p>Today in Osaka has a number of world-leading companies, research institutes and
					individuals are active in various fields. Osaka is proud of the Kansai International Airport,
					which is open around the clock, as well as its highly-extensive railway network and food
					culture. Osaka welcomes visitors from the world with Osaka-style "omotenashi"
					(hospitality).
					Osaka has been attracting people from around the world by holding various international
					events such as the Japan World Exposition (1970), the International Garden and Greenery Exposition (1990), the APEC Summit (1994), the Track and Field World Championships
					(2007), Rugby World Cup(2020) and World Masters Games in Kansai (2021).

				<p>
					Having been the center of economic and
					cultural development for many centuries,
					Osaka has many traditional and modern
					sightseeing attractions, including Bunraku (a
					traditional puppet theater designated by
					UNESCO as an intangible cultural asset),
					Osaka Castle, Universal Studios Japan™ and
					Kaiyukan aquarium, which is one of the
					largest aquariums in the world. There are
					always things to do, places to visit and new
					things to discover.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					
					One of Osaka's greatest advantages is its proximity to the many World Heritage sites which
					are scattering through the cities of Kyoto, Nara, Kobe and Wakayama, some no more than
					30 minutes away. Day trips can also be made to Hiroshima, Nagoya and even Tokyo.

					Known for its rich food culture, Osaka is a
					gourmet paradise offering the best from land
					and sea. Shopping is also a delight in this city
					where is famous as a City of Merchants. The
					city has the largest underground mall and the
					longest shopping arcade in Japan, in addition
					to many department stores, outlet malls and
					stores selling top fashion brands, and, of
					course, the famous Nipponbashi consumer
					electronics district.
