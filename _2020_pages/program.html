		<h1>Conference program</h1>
		
		<p>
We plan to have a number of events as listed below. Events that form the core of the
conference are described next:
		</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Regular Paper Sessions: </b>Paper sessions will be determined by the type and areas</li>
of the papers accepted. A best paper session will be allocated with those papers</li>
that received the highest score in the peer review process. These sessions will take</li>
place in the multi-purpose hall. If needed, parallel sessions can be held</li>
in rooms called Room-A. These sessions form the core of the conference</li>
schedule.</li>
<li><b>Competition Session: </b>As in previous CIG conferences, multiple competitions will be</li>
held and results of those will be presented in a session (plenary or parallel,</li>
depending on the number of competitions organized).</li>
<li><b>Poster and Demonstration session: </b>Poster presentations and technical demos will</li>
be held in the multi-purpose hall.</li>
<li><b>Keynote talks: </b>We plan to invite three keynote speakers for the last 3 days of the</li>
conference. The keynote talks will be plenary and held in the multi-purpose hall.</li>
<li><b>Industry Session: </b>This session will count on speakers from the game industry that</li>
present their work to the audience. There will be a call for talk proposals. Once their</li>
talk proposals are accepted, these speakers are charged reduced registration fees</li>
but do not submit a paper for inclusion in the proceedings. The objective of this</li>
session is two-fold: i) we expect to bring game industry professionals to the</li>
conference to attend high quality talks (who would pay normal registration fees) and</li>
ii) promote a higher collaboration between the fields of game academic and</li>
industry.</li>
<li><b>Panel/Open mic Sessions: </b>In order to promote this last point, we will hold a panel</li>
with experts, followed by an open mic session, designed to find collaborations and</li>
identify industry needs.</li>
<li><b>Tutorial Sessions: </b>Several tutorials will be delivered on the first day of the</li>
conference, to be held in the multi-purpose hall. If needed, parallel sessions can</li>
also be held in Room-As.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Additionally, the following social events are scheduled.
				</p>
				<ul>
<li><b>The Welcome Party </b>will be held at the LOUNGE in the academic theater on the
main campus, where is within 5 minutes walking distance from the conference
venue, on the first evening.</li>
<li><b>The Social Evening </b>will be held on the second day, we will take the participants to
Namba area. In this area, three big game-centers are located within 100 meters,
which are operated by major Japanese arcade game companies: BANDAI NAMCO,
SEGA and Taito.</li>
<li><b>The Banquet and Award Ceremony </b>will be held at the Swissotel Nankai, where is
within 7 minutes walking distance from the game centers, on the third day of the
conference.</li>
